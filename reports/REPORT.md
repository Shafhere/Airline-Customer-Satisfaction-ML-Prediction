## I developed an end-to-end airline passenger satisfaction prediction system. I performed data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and scaling. I compared multiple classification models, selected Decision Tree as a strong baseline, and improved performance using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. I optimized the model using hyperparameter tuning, applied dimensionality reduction for analysis, built an Artificial Neural Network for deep learning, validated the model using cross-validation, and finally tested it using real-world passenger data
